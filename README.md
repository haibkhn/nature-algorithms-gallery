### Genetic Art Generator

A creative tool that uses genetic algorithms to recreate images in different artistic styles.

#### Implemented Styles:
1. **Geometric**
   - Uses basic shapes (circles, triangles, rectangles)
   - Adjustable number of shapes and sizes
   - Evolutionary optimization for best representation

2. **Pointillism**
   - Creates art using small dots
   - High density of points
   - Color sampling from original image

3. **Mosaic**
   - Tile-based image recreation
   - Grout effect between tiles
   - Adjustable tile sizes

4. **Stained Glass**
   - Glass panel effect with leading
   - Irregular shapes
   - Translucent color effects

#### Features:
- Image upload support
- Real-time generation preview
- Side-by-side comparison
- Slider view for before/after comparison
- Adjustable mutation rates
- Style-specific settings
- Generation statistics
- Fitness tracking
